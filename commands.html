<p class="behold">Behold, a simple walkthrough detailing each command of the Aucbot awaits you.</p>

<button class="collapsible">setpurse</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>This is the command by which you can set the purse of a user.</p>
<p>Required Arguments: Purse can be in million or billions. For your ease, I have added 'm' and 'b' features. For example, if you want to set the purse of user @Khawer#6683 to 3 million, you can type [prefix] setpurse @Khawer#6683 3m. This will set their purse to 3 million. If you use the command prefix setpurse @Khawer#6683 3 millions, it will break.</p>
<p>Aliases: sp</p>
<p>Required Permission/Role: You need administrator permission or the Auctioneer (case sensitive) role to be able to run this command.</p>
</div>

<button class="collapsible">setlogchannel</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>This is the command by which you can set the logging channel where the bot will type all the logs of your auction.</p>
<p>Required Arguments: You need to provide a logging channel or its ID.</p>
<p>Aliases: slc</p>

<button class="collapsible">bal</button>

<p>Required Arguments: &lt;player you want to sell&gt; &lt;base price&gt; [increment]. For example, $sell Kohli 4m 3m.

<p>This command is easy to use and does not require any special permissions or roles.</p>
